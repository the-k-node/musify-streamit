Musify is an Online Music Streaming Android Application. Yeah ofcourse can import and enjoy how it looks and explore its contents and experience its User interface and navigation structures. Anyway, any Android Application will be rated mostly on its one main feature, which is UI, the more the good looking UI it is, the greater the Attraction rate.

Music has been a great asset especially in this Quarantine, everybody started to Binge who even didn't knew about this. Music is another great sector which is getting improved everyday with highest audience available. This application is built using various github components and credits to their respective owners and this repository is solely a personal project and made a fair usage of all repos under respective licenses. 

PS: Suggested to import this project using Android Studio for better Version Management and Hassle-free experience.
